Hi I am John Wright.

I am a programmer and a clean coder.  I enjoy designing software and do it for a living.  Yeah I'm lucky.

My primary language is Java but I am interested in languages a lot and enjoy python, golang, javascript, and kotlin as well.  I am always open to learning a new language.

more to come....
